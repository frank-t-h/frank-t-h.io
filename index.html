        <p>I've been an open source newbie for eight years.</p>

<p>Time to stick my toe in the water.</p>

<p>I am dabbling with html 5, css and javascript.</p>

<p>I am meddling with c++ and am getting to grips with namespace errors.</p>

<p>I like to fiddle around in MYSQL/Maria DB and have to run the only os for me... linux.</p>

<p>I was devastated about the announcement of "the h" blog being discontinued and would like to help in the production of anything new in the pipeline. Frank tries ... what did he break this time?</p>

<p>I recently moved from Ubuntu through to Mint and then back to Debian.</p>
